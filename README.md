## 🧓 Why Sanjh?

> “I always saw my grandparents sitting quietly, isolated, with a phone in hand but unsure how to use it. They depended on others for even the smallest tasks. That’s when I decided to build *Sanjh* — an app that would give them their own space, comfort, and independence through simple technology.”  

Sanjh bridges the digital gap for the elderly with warmth, simplicity, and purpose.
